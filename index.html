<font size=4> <p align="center"> Since 2000, Coal-based energy production has dropped by over 20%.
The 2011 EPA rules regulating coal-based pollution emissions (under the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS)) under the Obama Administration
coincides with the particularly sharp drop-off in coal-based energy production around that time. </p>
